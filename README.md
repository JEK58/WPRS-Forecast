# WPRS Forecast

This app calculates the possible WPRS points for the winner of a paragliding cross-country competition. The forecast is based on the currently confirmed pilots and their CIVL rankings. The calculation will become more accurate as the competition date approaches.

### Limitations: 
For technical reasons, the calculation of a comp listed on civlcomps.org is currently less accurate than on airtribune.com.
